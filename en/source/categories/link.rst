These guidelines are for links.

Here, links refer to elements that users can click (or touch) to navigate to another page or perform some action. Links can be text-only, icon-only, or a combination of text and image.
In addition to those implemented with the ``a`` element, this also includes those implemented with the ``button`` element or implemented with the appropriate ``role`` attribute attached.
